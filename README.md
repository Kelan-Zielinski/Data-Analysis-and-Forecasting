I undertook a data analysis and forecasting project using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Leveraging the pandas library, I efficiently read and processed data from various files for thorough analysis. I implemented several forecasting methods to identify and visualize trends within the data, providing clear and insightful representations of potential future patterns. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the forecasts, I calculated the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each model, allowing me to evaluate and determine the most effective forecasting method.
